# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

#### Android

Use Expo Go with one of these commands:
- `npm run go` (recommended for physical devices, uses tunnel)
- `npm run start` then scan the QR code in Expo Go
- `npm run android` for an Android emulator with Expo Go

If a previous dev server was running, clear cache once:
- `npx expo start -c --go --tunnel`

If Expo Go shows `Failed to download remote update`:
- make sure phone internet is working and Expo Go is updated
- close Expo Go, run `npx expo start -c --go --tunnel`, then scan the new QR
- disable VPN/private DNS/ad blocker on phone and retry

#### Web

Web previews will be started and managred automatically. Use the toolbar to manually refresh.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
